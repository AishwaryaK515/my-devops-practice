What is Ansible
why do we need Ansible
How to install and start with basic steps 


Ansible is an open source IT configuration management , deployment and orchestration tool
it aims to provide large productivity gains to a variety of automation challenges

***   if u want to automate complex multi tier IT application environments we can use ansible

before ansible
   previously system administrator manages server by hand then installing software , chamging configurations and administring servives on individual server
  - now adays , data centre is growing and hosted applications became more complx
  - then administartors realized/decided they couldnt scale their manual system
  - it will also impact the work of developers since the development team was agile and releaisng software frequently  , but it operations are spending more time configuring  the system
  - for example :
     develop got a work that they have to create a java microservice with gradle and deploy that 
     devops engineer: has to create environments like
                     development env , QA env  , UAT/staging env  , production env 
           in all the places , he has to make sure all the required configurations are there for server
           if he fails to do that, the entire work of developers will be impacted because the software releaeses will go very frequently and there will br continous deployment 

besically we have to focus on 
1. server provisioning
2. configuration management

Ansible terminology :
controller machine
inventry
playbook
task
module
role
play
facts
handlers

1. controller machine:
    A Machine where ansible installed , responsible for running the provisioning(creation of something) on the server ypu are managing
    controller machine is a place where we install Ansible and from it we will try to run something on this 2 machines and if we want to manage this 2 servers , we run those scripts or we provision what ever we
          want to do on the server from the controller machine 
       example:
              let say we want to manage 2 server like amazon or RHEL or Ubuntu
              server1 - install ansible - manage server2 or server 3......
